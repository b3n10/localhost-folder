				<p>
				Thank you for visiting my site. I'm Ben and a Web Developer aspirant. The purpose I made this page is to put on what I've learned so far and to even learn more about web technologies. I'm currently looking for a company that is willing to give me a chance to work as a web developer even I don't have work-related programming experience. And as of the moment, I'm employed as a Call Center Representative here in Angeles, Pampanga for almost 6 years, but now is the time I am taking steps of learning to look for the career of my passion.

				<p>
				I started coding since the I learned programming back in my highschool days where I still remember getting 100% score for building a calculator app using Visual Basic language. Since then, I took a 2 yr college course for software programming and continue to fall in love with the concept of typing codes that results to a program. My basic skils are responsive web design using HTML5, CSS and Javascript; dynamic web design with PHP &amp; MySQL; familiarity usage with Git version control; and using Linux as my daily driver for 6 years now.

				<h3>Family</h3>

				<p>
				My family is what I'm always thankful for. They are my inspiration every time I get off from bed to work and earn money or else we will have a hard time paying our bills. Hehehe. <br>I'm the least sibling in our family and I have 1 niece and 2 nephews I play with during my free time. My mom cooks delicous food for us while my dad fixes house stuffs even though they're are not broken.

				<h3>Friends</h3>

				<p>
				I have few friends but that is okay. The more friends you have, the more problems you also have. Just kidding. We meet at a weekly basis at our favorite fast food restaurant around Dau and discuss about Christian life and how we can encourage each other. We ocassionaly go out to celebrate a friend's birthday in a friend's house or go out for a swimming with a small budget.
