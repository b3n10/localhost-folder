		<p>Welcome to this part of my page where I will discuss a few things about my life. It will make this too boring to read if I will share all things about me.</p>
		<article>
			<section>
				<div id="my-family" class="div-margin-bottom">&nbsp;</div>
				<h2>Family</h2>
				<p>We are a family of 5 members. Both my Mom and Dad are retired from professional work, while my 2 older sisters have daily jobs as a Teacher and Call Center agent respectively. And that makes me the least sibling in our family. During my free time, I also take care my 3yo old nephew of my older sister and play games with my 5yo nephew and 10yo niece both children of my eldest sister.</p>

			<section id="my-friends">
				<div id="my-friends" class="div-margin-bottom">&nbsp;</div>
				<h2>Friends</h2>
				<p>My friends I can call close to me can be counted with my fingers on both my hands and feet. We meet every saturdays usually in Fast Food Restos or one of our houses. Our topic is about Christian Faith to encourage one another in our lives. And occasionally we go out for a swimming to celebrate a friend's birthday or just enjoy playing badminton.</p>

				<h2>Interets</h2>
				<p>I don't want to call myself a fan but I enjoy watching Golden State Warriors in basketball and also FC Barcelona in football. I also run 3 days in a week for 3km each day which I started as a hobby since last year. I'm also interested in taking online courses that are related to computer science.</p>

				<h2>Aspiration</h2>
				<p>My ambition in life is either to become an anstronaut to be sent to planet Mars or be a Web Developer. The latter sounds realistic. I will contribute to the society by developing softwares to the advance either on web technologies or desktop applications. It will take me a lot of learnings to achieve it and that's the path I want to take. I'm already starting it and hopefully my projects will help us on our daily lives.</p>
